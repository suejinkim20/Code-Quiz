# Code-Quiz
Unit 4: Web APIs Homework

## Description

This application is a timed coding quiz which stores the player's score. 

* When the question is answered correctly, the score is increased  by 10 pts and the player moves on to the next question.
* When the question is answered incorrectly, the player does not receive points for the question and the timer decrements 15 seconds as a penalty.
* When the game is over the player can see their final score and enter their initials to save their score.
* They should then be able to see a list of high scores on the high scores page.

The following issues still need to be resolved:
* Currently, the score is being stored to local storage, but the scores are not displaying on the high score page.
* When the game is played multiple times, the high scores need to be sorted by score from highest to lowest and display the highest three.
